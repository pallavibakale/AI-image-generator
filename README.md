# AI-Powered Design Generator

## What is this?
This is a simple app that turns your text descriptions into images using OpenAI's DALL·E model. Just type in what you want to see, pick the number of images, and let AI do the rest!

## What You Need
- Python 3.7+
- `gradio`, `openai`, `requests`, `pillow`

## How to Use It
1. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install gradio openai requests pillow
   ```
2. Set your OpenAI API key:
   - Replace `openai_api_key_placeholder` in the script with your actual API key.
   - Or set it as an environment variable:
     ```sh
     export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
     ```
3. Run the app:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open the provided link in your browser and start generating images!

## Notes
- Make sure your OpenAI API key has access to DALL·E.
- Image generation may take a few seconds depending on complexity.
- Built for fun and creativity—enjoy experimenting!
